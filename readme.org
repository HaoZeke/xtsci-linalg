* About
#+begin_quote
This has no official relationship to either ~xtensor~ or ~scipy~!!!
#+end_quote

Part of the larger ~xtsci~ project, which iteratively implements parts of
~scipy~ using ~xtensor~ and modern C++ based on my needs. At some point (or with
funding) this might cover all of ~scipy~, but its really more of a rapid
prototyping thing.

** Components
The heart of the library is the ~xts~ namespace, with functions further
demarcated according to the relevant ~scipy~ modules e.g.
~xts::linalg::iterative::conjugate_gradient~.

** Usage

Other than the regular library usage, there are also very light ~python~ bindings:
#+begin_src bash
meson setup bbdir -Dwith_pybind11=True --buildtype="release"
meson compile -C bbdir
# Temporary
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/bbdir/bindings/pyb11
python scripts/basic_cg_bench.py
Benchmarking xtsl's Conjugate Gradient:
Average time per iteration: 0.000003 seconds

Benchmarking scipy's Conjugate Gradient:
Average time per iteration: 0.000057 seconds
